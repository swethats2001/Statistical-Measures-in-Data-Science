In this work: 
1. Performed basic EDA
2. Created a box plot and used this to determine which method seems to work best to remove outliers for this data
3. Detected the outliers using following methods and removed it using methods like trimming / capping/ imputation using mean or median.
a) Mean and Standard deviation
b)Percentile method
c) IQR(Inter quartile range method)
d) Z Score method
4. Drew histplot to check the normality of the column(price per sqft column) and performed transformations. Checked the skewness and kurtosis before and after the transformation.
5. Checked the correlation between all the numerical columns and plotted a heatmap.
6. Drew Scatter plot between the variables to check the correlation between them.
